1. INTRODUCTION
The Amazing OOW Sound Effect addon by Larenon / Leirren / Pio

This addon is a modified version of a really old addon which was called LeeroyHillCatsPower (no longer available as the addon site where it was hosted no longer exists).

The main purpose of this addon is to summon into your own raids the tactical instructions of the immortal raid leader, Dives of the guild Wipe Club. Besides that, there are also other sound effects in the addon too, which might serve well to spice up an otherwise dull raid.

Please note, that this revival of the original addon was started as an internal, guild only project for the hungarian guild Order of Watchers on Ragnaros-EU. Therefore many of the effects are in hungarian and some of them are internal guild jokes only meaningful for members of our guild. Soon (tm) when I'm going to implement a graphical options window, you'll be able to filter these hungarian / Order of Watchers effects from the addon.

2. USAGE

The simplest way to use the addon is to make a macro with the "/lhcf" command (without the quotes of course). Put that macro into an action bar. When you click it, a little window comes up with red buttons, where you can click on any effect you like. This window can be hidden by pressing the "ESC" button, clicking on the close button in the top right corner or by typing the /lhcf command into your chat. The window can also be moved anywhere on your screen by pressing and holding the left mouse button. You can make macros for your favorite sound effects too, and put those macros also on an action bar for easy reach. Don't be afraid to throw out your rarely used abilities (taunt, rejuvenation, arcane blast, etc) to make room for sound effect macros. :-) The real pro guys playing WOW from under DOS of course don't use a GUI, buttons or macros, they are hardcore enough to type the macro commands directly into the command line.

The sound effects made by the addon will be heard by everyone near you, who has this addon installed. Spread the word!

DISCLAIMER

Of course as with any other good things, if you are using the sound effects excessively (also called: spamming), then after some time they might cease to be funny, become irritating and that might even result in someone - horribile dictu - uninstalling the addon. Therefore, please try to keep it under control! This is especially true during raids, where your focused attention is required during bosskils. Therefore please refrain from using the addon during boss kill attempts, and only fire up a sound effect or two if it's really needed for a good laugh's sake. :-)

The authors of the addon (Larenon <Order of Watchers> / Ragnaros-EU, Leirren <Order of Watchers> / Ragnaros-EU és Pio <Order of Watchers> / Ragnaros-EU) assume no responsibility whatsoever for any unpleasantries resulting from the use of the addon including but not limited to: receiving fifty DKP minus for excessive spamming, being kicked out of a raid or your guild, etc). But they would very much like to hear your story if something like that happens to you. :-))

VERSION HISTORY

v5.2b - 16 February 2017
- You can now choose what language the addon should use, when you first run it after this update
- You can now right click on each of the buttons and choose whether you hate that effect or really like it (or both if you want to be really different from the crowd). If you hate it, the button will go grey and you won't hear that sound effect ever again (until you right click again and "unhate" it). If you favorite it, the button will also appear on the tab called "fav", which collects all your favorited sound effects for easy reach.
- The help command again only has one version which is /lhcf help. It will pop up a little window with the help text shown in the language you chose for the addon.
- This is a beta release, please try to break it and report the bugs you find.

v5.1 - 05 February 2017
- The addon is published on Curse.
- The /lhcf help command now has a /lhcf help eng version, to accommodate any international users. :-)

v5.0 - 05 February 2017
- The addon is completely rewritten, the code has been optimized, the extremely bloated addon consisting of about 2300 lines, has been thinned down to a more manageable 472 lines
- To prevent spamming those players not using this addon, it is now using only emotes, not spamming the say channel at all. Due to this change, the earlier versions are no longer compatible with this one, therefore everyone is recommended to update the addon to this latest version.
- The addon graphic frame now has tabs like the Android app version made by Gyerob. Sound effects are assigned to the same categories as they are in the Android app.
- In theory Mercy can now really be heard sometimes from the Overwatch universe.
- As advertised on the internal guild messageboards, the addon is planned to be updated with more sound effects in the near future.
- The next planned bigger update would be the implementation of a settings frame where those sound effects the user absolutely hates can be disabled, never to be heard again.

v4.7 - 26 January 2017
- Sometimes (with a 50% chance), when your character is offered to be resurrected by another player, someone can be heard yelling "HEROES NEVER DIE!" from the Overwatch universe, due to a strange space-time continuum anomaly

v4.6 - 24 July 2016
- Version updated for Legion by Pio. Thanks!

v4.5 - 08 February 2012
- The sound effects now always have the volume of the maximum volume you've set in your game settings, even in case the "Effects Sound Volume" setting is set for a lower volume

- The /lhcf <color> command can now be used to show the addon frame with various background colors. <color> can be: black, blue, pink, red, green, yellow, white

- The addon now has the /megvagy sound effect
- Sometimes (with a 10% chance) when you open the merchant frame of a vendor in the world, Commander Shepard declares that it's his favorite store

v3.22 - 10 December 2010
- Some effects now have Youtube links in the readme, in case someone doesn't know them. It should be noted however that these videos are part of the general knowledge of mankind, so if someone has not yet seen them, they should immediately correct this fault :-)

- readme.txt updated
- The addon commands changed. Now the only slash command is the /lhcf and the sound effects should be appended to it, like so: "/lhcf hshot"

v3.2 - 08 December 2010
- The addon is no longer spamming the say channel, only a say bubble can be seen, like it was working about 3 years ago. :-)
- Now some of the emotes shown by the addon changes depending on the target selected when the sound effect is activated.
